Points you could include in this section are the general description of the program/application and the Python functions/features that will be implemented to achieve the end project you aim for.

General Project Description:

AgriMentor, the Soil Monitoring Application for Smallholder Farmers, aims to empower farmers in Africa by revolutionizing agricultural practices through technology, facilitating real-time monitoring of soil metrics like moisture levels and acidity with IoT sensors, offering personalized crop recommendations, and providing a comprehensive suite of features to enhance agricultural productivity, elevate incomes, and promote sustainable development.

Python Functions/Features:

1. Soil Monitoring Functionality: Python functions will collect and analyze real-time data from IoT sensors, focusing on key soil parameters like moisture levels and acidity, to continuously monitor soil conditions and provide accurate insights.

2. Crop Recommendation Algorithm: Python algorithms will process soil data and recommend suitable crops for cultivation based on factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, and market demand, utilizing machine learning techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

3. Decision Support System: Python functions will provide decision support tools, analyzing soil data, weather forecasts, and market trends to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, planting schedules, and resource management.


Interface Requirements
Points you could include in this section:
●	Explained the functionalities the application will provide to users in terms of the interface the User will be interacting with when it's completed.
*** 
Example: The users will interact with the application from the terminal or the IDE. When the program starts 
●	A user will be presented with a warm welcome and info consisting of the functionality of the app
●	They will be prompted to enter the details collected from the sensors such as  the acidity, and  moisture.
●	Prompt the user to input the kind of crops they want to plant
>>> Do you have any specific crop in mind? Y/N
             
●	If user answers Y then prompts the user to input the crops
●	Else move to the next step
●	Analyzes the data based on the conditions and  market trends
●	If the market trends are good and the solid conditions are favorable
●	Display the kind of crops that will be profitable else
●	Tell the user that the conditions are not favorable for planting
●	Thank  the user for using the platform.

Design Constraints
In this section, think about any limitations you may face as a group as you work on the project. Limitations may be in terms of software, hardware, or Skills.

For this project, we will only use Python. The program will not have a GUI. Users will interact with the program in the terminal of the Visual Studio Code that will be used for the implementation.

Since we don’t have the necessary IoT hardware to sample the soil, we will be asking the farmers to input data relating to soil conditions and other information and use that to provide recommendations.
